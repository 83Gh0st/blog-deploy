## Setting Up the Blog Platform

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Run the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/83Gh0st/blog-deploy.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd blog-deploy
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure the Environment
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables (if using Supabase or other integrations):
```env

GOOGLE_ID=
GOOGLE_SECRET=


NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET= your-secret


DATABASE_URL="your mongodb database url"

FIREBASE="  "




NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://---------.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..-----"

```

### Step 4: Run the Development Server
Start the local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the blog in action.

### Step 5: Deploy to Vercel
1. Login to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. Import your GitHub repository.
3. Follow the steps to deploy the blog platform.

## Customization

### 1. **Adding Posts**
- Posts can be added as Markdown files or through an integrated CMS (if connected to Supabase or another backend).
- Ensure your content is well-structured and engaging.

### 2. **Theming**
- Update `styles` files in the `styles` folder to customize the look and feel.
- Use CSS variables for global theming.

### 3. **Integrations**
- Add analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) for tracking user interactions.
- Enable social sharing for better reach.
